# LexPredict Legal Dictionaries
==================
## Purpose
Many academic and commercial applications of natural language processing and machine learning to text can benefit from a controlled lexicon of expert-selected terms (i.e., a dictionary).  This is especially true of highly technical language, such as legal text.  However, no open source and freely-available dictionaries of this nature have been available.  

Our goal is to change this fact.  Our open-source document analytics platform, [ContraxSuite](https://contraxsuite.com), is just one of the projects that will benefit.  We expect many other researchers and companies to both benefit and contribute.

## Contents
The contents and organization of this legal dictionary repository will evolve as the community participates and our products evolve.  However, our vision is to work towards multi-domain, multi-lingual, and cross-lingual resources for legal and regulatory text.
